# Using hipBLAS on Windows

To get hipBLAS in `stable-diffusion.cpp` working on Windows, go through this guide section by section.

## Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022

Skip this step if you already have Build Tools installed.

To install Build Tools, go to [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), download `Visual Studio 2022 and other Products` and run the installer.

## CMake

Skip this step if you already have CMake installed: running `cmake --version` should output `cmake version x.y.z`.

Download latest `Windows x64 Installer` from [Download | CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and run it.

## ROCm

Skip this step if you already have Build Tools installed.

The [validation tools](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/reference/validation_tools.html) not support on Windows. So you should confirm the Version of `ROCM` by yourself.

Fortunately, `AMD` provides complete help documentation, you can use the help documentation to install [ROCM](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/windows/quick_start.html)

> **If you encounter an error, if it is [AMD ROCm Windows Installation Error 215](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/issues/2363), don't worry about this error. ROCM has been installed correctly, but the vs studio plugin installation failed, we can ignore it.**

Then we must set `ROCM` as environment variables before running cmake.

Usually if you install according to the official tutorial and do not modify the ROCM path, then there is a high probability that it is here `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.5\bin`

This is what I use to set the clang:

```Commandline
set CC=C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.5\bin\clang.exe
set CXX=C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.5\bin\clang++.exe
```

## Ninja

Skip this step if you already have Ninja installed: running `ninja --version` should output `1.11.1`.

Download latest `ninja-win.zip` from [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases/tag/v1.11.1) and unzip. Then set as environment variables. I unzipped it in `C:\Program Files\ninja`, so I set it like this:

```Commandline
set ninja=C:\Program Files\ninja\ninja.exe
```

## Building stable-diffusion.cpp

The thing different from the regular CPU build is `-DSD_HIPBLAS=ON` ,
`-G "Ninja"`, `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang`, `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++`, `-DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1100`

Note:
If you encounter an error such as the following:

```Commandline
lld-link: error: undefined symbol
```

Include the `-DGGML_OPENMP=OFF` argument in the CMake options to disable OpenMP, which, despite being marked as supported, is broken for ROCm on Windows. While it may work with newer ROCm versions, it generally has no impact unless you are partially offloading a model or using NKVO.

> **Notice**: check the `clang` and `clang++` information:

```Commandline
clang --version
clang++ --version
```

If you see like this, we can continue:

```
clang version 17.0.0 (git@github.amd.com:Compute-Mirrors/llvm-project e3201662d21c48894f2156d302276eb1cf47c7be)
Target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.5\bin
```

```
clang version 17.0.0 (git@github.amd.com:Compute-Mirrors/llvm-project e3201662d21c48894f2156d302276eb1cf47c7be)
Target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.5\bin
```

> **Notice** that the `gfx1100` is the GPU architecture of my GPU, you can change it to your GPU architecture. Click here to see your architecture [LLVM Target](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/release/windows_support.html#windows-supported-gpus)

As an example, if you have an AMD Radeonâ„¢ RX 7900 XTX Graphics Card you would set it to `gfx1100`.

You can find the GPU architecture of your GPU in the [Accelerator and GPU hardware specifications](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/reference/gpu-arch-specs.html) in the ROCm documentation.

## Running stable-diffusion.cpp

You may also need to specify your device ID if your system has multiple GPUs (such as an integrated GPU) by setting: `$env:HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1` (Replace "1" with the appropriate device ID for your setup).

In addition, setting the `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` environment variable to the GPU architecture of your GPU with the following command is recommended: `$env:HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.1`
